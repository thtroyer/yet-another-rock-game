This is the initial release of yarg, or Yet Another Rock Game.  Though I haven't been able to test it as much as I'd like, I expect it to run without hassle on Windows and should be simple to compile on Linux(i.e. $ make $ ./yarg).

If you have problems with running yarg, feel free to drop me a line at tom.troyer@gmail.com or file a bug report at http://code.google.com/p/yet-another-rock-game/issues.  Reporting error messages or unexpected behavior would be helpful to me in fixing these problems.  

On to more useful things...
Controls:
Arrow keys -- controls.
Spacebar -- bullets.
q -- Quit.

I indend to add scoring, limited lives, and some general playability fixes and tweaks in the next version.

Enjoy.
